# FeelFlow.ai
Purpose:

FeelFlow.ai is a website empowered by ChatGPT and Spotify's API to recommend various songs to anyone who is willing to expand their playlist. The source of my data comes from, of course, ChatGPT and Spotify's music database. To use FeelFlow.ai, the user will type in whatever they want into the textbox. They can type in their feelings such as "I feel great today!" or even something abstract like "friend". After they type in something, they can either press enter on the keyboard or click on the "Give me a song recommendation!" button. The corresponding result will show up below the textbox, listing the album name and cover, track title, artist name, duration, and a 30 second preview of the song. 

The motivation behind FeelFlow.ai is that many people may be thinking of adding new songs to their playlist, but don’t know where to start from. FeelFlow.ai will provide them with a wide range of choices, and users may be able to find music that fits their taste. Additionally, the Random Song! page will give the user an absolutely random song if the user wants to listen to a completely random song.

Instructions:

1. In the homepage, type in literally anything to the text box
2. Wait a few seconds, and the website will give you a song to match your feelings or whatever you typed in
3. If you would like to maintain a manual playlist, click on “Add Song” in the nav bar
4. Type in the song details and click submit
5. You can see your song has been added to your playlist by clicking on “My Playlist” from the nav bar
6. You can also delete or edit any song entries from My Playlist
7. If you want a completely random song, click on “Random Song!” in the nav bar!
